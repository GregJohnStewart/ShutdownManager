So you want to compile my program....

Windows:

	Import to your favorite c++ code developer suite (I use Visual Studio
		Express 2013)
	
	Compile
	
	Done!
	
Linux/Unix:

	Slightly more complicated, as typically you will be compiling by command
		line, without a fancy IDE to do things for you.
		
	MUST HAVE A COMPILER INSTALLED
	
	I used g++, a very common compiler
	Examples are using g++
	
	TLDR:	(quick and easy, outputs to a.out)
	
		g++ -pthread -std=c++11 ShutdownManager.cpp
	
		-pthread	to link the thread libraries
		-std=c++11	to tell it that this is c++v2011 standard
	
	To Specify output:
	
		g++ -pthread -std=c++11 ShutdownManager.cpp -o OUTPUT.FILE
		
		-pthread	to link the thread libraries
		-std=c++11	to tell it that this is c++v2011 standard
		OUTPUT.FILE	whatever file you want to output to
